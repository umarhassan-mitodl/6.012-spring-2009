Grading
-------

All the items below will enter into the computation of the final grade.

### Quizzes

Two two-hour evening quizzes, open book, calculator required.

### Final Exam

Three hours, open book, calculator required.

### Homework

A total of eight problem sets will be handed out. The homework must be turned in by 4pm sharp on the due date. A 50% penalty will be applied to homework turned in after 4pm. Homework turned in after solutions are distributed (about 3 days later) will be graded, but no credit will be given. All exceptions to this policy have to be approved by the lecturer. All homework sets will weigh equally towards the final grade.

### Design Problem and Web Labs

The design problem will be handed out one day after L12 and will be due one day after L17. There will also be two Web labs that will introduce you to real live device characterization. If you turn in the design problem or any of the Web labs after its due date, the same policy as late homework applies.

### Attendance

We expect students to attend lectures and recitations, and we will keep track of attendance. The attendance record will be counted for 10% of the final grade.

The course grade will be determined as follows:
